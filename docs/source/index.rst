Welcome to ramp's documentation!
================================

Ramp is a python package for rapid machine learning prototyping.
It provides a simple, declarative syntax
for exploring features, algorithms and transformations quickly and efficiently.
At its core it's a unified `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_-based framework for working with
existing python machine learning and statistics libraries (scikit-learn, rpy2, etc.).

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Easy and methodical model comparison and evaluation
* Clean components for features, models, and results
* Comprehensive suite of tools for measuring, validating, and building, blending, and composing models.
* Easily extensible API
